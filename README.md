# Social-Distancing-Detector using Yolo v3
## **Introduction**
COVID-19 was initially reported during late
December, 2020 in Wuhan, China. And within three
months, it had spreaded in more tha 114 countries and
caused more than 3000 deaths and then WHO declared
this as a pandemic.According to a report by
W.H.O, practicing social distancing and wearing mask
is an important measure to slow down the spread of
virus as individuals with mild indications may
accidentally convey crowd contamination and can
spread the virus to others. Social Distancing implies
that people are suggested that they should maintain
physical distance from one another, reduce close
contact, and thereby reduce the spread of virus. To
automate the task of monitoring social distancing,
concepts of computer vision and deep learning can be
taken into consideration. Computer vision is a field of
artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to
derive meaningful information from digital images,
videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or
make recommendations based on that information. The
objects in the image/video are detected in real-time
using YOLO(You only look once), an algorithm
supported by convolutional neural networks which are
employed for the detection and to determine the
distance between the human using clusters of
pedestrians during a neighborhood by grabbing the
feed from a video.

## **Aim**
Our aim is to make an application
that automates the task of monitoring social distancing
among people to hinder the spread of COVID-19.
